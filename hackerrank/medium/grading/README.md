# Grading Students

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

* Every student receives a $grade$ in the inclusive range from $0$ to $100$.
* Any $grade$ less than $40$ is a failing grade. 

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's $grade$ according to these rules:

* If the difference between the $grade$ and the next multiple of $5$ is less than $3$, round $grade$ up to the next multiple of $5$.
* If the value of $grade$ is less than $38$, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

**Examples**

- $grade = 84$ round to $85$ (85 - 84 is less than 3)  
- $grade = 29$ do not round (result is less than 38)  
- $grade = 57$ do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)   

Given the initial value of $grade$ for each of Sam's $n$ students, write code to automate the rounding process.   

**Function Description**  

Complete the function $gradingStudents$ with the following parameter(s):  

- $int\ grades[n]$: the grades before rounding  

**Returns**

- $int[n]$: the grades after rounding

**Input Format**

The first line contains a single integer, $n$, the number of students. 		
Each line $i$ of the $n$ subsequent lines contains a single integer, $grades[i]$.

**Constraints**

* $ 1 \le n \le 60 $
* $ 0 \le grades[i] \le 100 $

**Output Format**

```py
#!/bin/python3

#
# Complete the 'gradingStudents' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.
# The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY grades as parameter.
#
import os
def get_next_multiple_of_5(from_range):
    for n in range(from_range, from_range + 10):
        if n % 5 == 0:
            return n

def gradingStudents(grades):
    # Write your code here
    result = []
    
    for grade in grades:
        n = get_next_multiple_of_5(grade)
        if n - grade < 3 and grade >= 38:
            result.append(n)
        else:
            result.append(grade)
    return result
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    grades_count = int(input().strip())

    grades = []

    for _ in range(grades_count):
        grades_item = int(input().strip())
        grades.append(grades_item)

    result = gradingStudents(grades)

    fptr.write('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    fptr.write('\n')

    fptr.close()

```
